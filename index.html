<h2>Gravital</h2>


<h4>High Concept:</h4>
<p>Navigate your way through the fabric of space and time while absorbing various collections of matter that you encounter in order to increase your mass and gravitational pull. Avoid being sucked in by stronger gravitational fields as you evolve from small asteroid to a black hole.
</p>

<h4>Player Experience Goals:</h4>
<p>The player should experience excitement at the prospect of absorbing many, large masses and upgrading their own mass. This also needs to be done in a timely manner as the player looses mass at a rate proportional to their current mass.
</p>

<h4>Genre:</h4>
<p>Physics based, casual strategy game.
</p>

<h4>Game play:</h4>
<p>The large asteroid is attracted to your mouse (keep the mouse close to the asteroid for a stronger pull), move the asteroid around and increase your mass as quickly as you can! You can only absorb masses that are smaller than your current mass. Don’t get caught in the gravitational pull of a mass larger than yourself! The player guides their mass around an infinite 2-D plane by gently accelerating it in the direction of the mouse pointer or with their finger on a mobile device. The player’s mass attracts (and is attracted by) other masses encountered in space. The player must accumulate mass by absorbing smaller masses, while avoiding making contact with larger masses. Different mini-objectives like finding satellites or making contact with various lifeforms can also be introduced. The player can use the gravitational pull of larger masses to their advantage by ‘slingshotting’ themselves through space at high velocity. The player can eject some of their own mass at high velocity in order to change their course or break larger masses into smaller pieces. The player may enter wormholes that will transport them to another area of the universe, or temporarily take the player to an alternate universe with different laws of physics and exotic materials. The goal of the game is to progress through the status of asteroid, planet, star, and finally supernovae into a black hole.
</p>

<h4>Prototype goal:</h4>
<p>The game demonstrates the ability to recycle sprites and reinitialize their properties, the ability to scroll around the world, and most importantly, the ability to apply gravitational force between many, many objects. 
</p>

<h4>Features:</h4>
<p>Explore the far reaches of outer space, and leverage gravitational interactions to your advantage.
Encounter many different masses with various physical properties like density and material. Comets move quickly and scatter mass behind them. White dwarf stars are small but super dense. Explore an infinitely large area of space as new objects are generated while you move along. Encounter interesting pieces of space-junk and signs of intelligent life as you explore.Experience alternate universes with foreign and exotic physical and material properties.
</p>

<h4>Setting/Premise:</h4>
<p>You are a rock in space, you need to absorb other masses smaller than yourself to increase your mass. At the same time you need to avoid other objectes whose mass is greater than yours, lest you get caught in their gravitational field and get absorbed by them! The game is set in outer space, where the player will encounter masses of various composition and size. Particularly interesting masses are comets travelling at high velocity, black holes, and ringed gas giants. The player will also encounter rarer man?-made objects like satellites and space-junk. Collecting these special materials will convey certain abilities or trigger events.</p>

<h4>Story:</h4>
<p>As above.</p>


<h4>Target Audience:</h4>
<p>Gravital is targeted at casual gamers, explorers, and logical thinkers who may want to play for short periods at a time and enjoy playing with physical simulations.
</p>

<h4>Play time:</h4>
<p>Last as long as you can, there will be thresholds for how low your mass can drop, as you upgrade to moon, and planet status.
</p>

<h4>Strategies:</h4>
<p>Calculate your approach toward strong gravitational fields to slingshot past potentially hazardous situations.</p>

 
<h4>Summary:</h4>
<p>This is a great game concept because it shares a relatively new core mechanic that has proven to be popular in competing games, but Gravital takes this concept much further with the additional features of physical simulation and endless world exploration. The theme of outer space also carries a huge potential for an incredibly immersive experience through grand visuals and an ambient electronic soundtrack. This game would be very appealing to the futuristic generation of gamers in our age of advanced technology, deep space exploration, and discovery of the forces that shape our universe. I have had fun developing the first prototype of the mechanic, and I am excited to see how these features can be implemented to improve the gameplay experience.</p>
