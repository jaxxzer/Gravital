<h2>Gravity KING!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Increase your mass as quickly as you can, while avoiding getting caught in the gravitational pull of masses larger than yourself. Upgrade through asteroid, moon, planet and star status. Become a black hole!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should experience excitement at the prospect of absorbing many, large masses and upgrading their own mass. This also needs to be done in a timely manner as the player looses mass at a rate proportional to their current mass.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Outer Space!
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The large asteroid is attracted to your mouse, move the asteroid around and increase your mass as quickly as you can! You can only absorb masses that are smaller than your current mass. Donâ€™t get caught in the gravitational pull of a mass larger than yourself!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The game demonstrates the ability to recycle sprites and reinitialize their properties, the ability to scroll around the world, and most importantly, the ability to apply gravitational force between many, many objects. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This is a really simple game that tests concentration and reactions. The enemies always start in random places, so each play is different.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a rock in space, you need to contact other rocks smaller than yourself to increase your mass. At the same time you need to avoid other objectes whose mass is greater than yours, lest you get caught in their gravitational field and get absorbed by them!</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
As above.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Ages 9 - 99.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Last as long as you can, there will be thresholds for how low your mass can drop, as you upgrade to moon, and planet status.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Find the center of gravity, and remain near it. Occasonally you can make a trip around the perimiter of the playable area, where heavier masses are spawned.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I came up with this myself, but there is a game called agar.io that is similar in some ways.
