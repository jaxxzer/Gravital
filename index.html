<h2>Watch OUT!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Move mario with the mouse to avoid the bombettes as long as you can!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should be involved in extreme focus and anticipation. The game will hopefully be fun enough to introduce a competitive desire to beat their own and others time record.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A single sentence that places the game within a game genre or a hybrid of genres.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Mario will follow the mouse. Move Mario around, to avoid the bombettes. The bombettes will speed up the longer you last, last as long as you can!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This game demonstrates the core functionality of controlling a sprite with mouse, and detecting collisions with enemy sprites.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This is a really simple game that tests concentration and reactions. The enemies always start in random places, so each play is different.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game doesn't really have a setting or premise. I just used Mario because they were the first pictures I found when I googled ".png". The pictures can be anything, including rectangles with the same experience. I would say this game is abstract.</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Bombs want to kill Mario, Mario doesnt want to die!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Ages 9 - 99.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
If you last more than 30 seconds, you're decent. If you last more than 40 seconds, you're really good!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Look past the screen, don't focus on a single sprite. Look past the screen so that you can see the movements of everything on the screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Asteroid Sprite: http://pics-about-space.com/asteroid-sprite-png?p=1#img4286174587685031102

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Game idea taken from here:
http://members.iinet.net.au/~pontipak/redsquare.html
Phaser examples were used soley for figuring out how to do certain things like detect collisions, and display time.
